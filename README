what's new:

- fork of Dr.Gadget plugin
- rop "payload" is saved to/loaded from IDB
- (hopefully universal) support for all processor modules
  supported by IDA itself (including 64bit etc.)
- "plugin" interface
- IDA disassembly is kept in its original state

this is an alpha version, not recommended for productive use

Dr.rer.oec.Gadget IDAPython Plugin
==================================

This is an IDAPython plugin for the
Interactive Disassembler for all your
ROP experimentation needs ;-)

Develop and analyze ROP exploits for
all processor architectures supported
by IDA itself!

what's new:

* This is fork of the 'original' Dr.Gadget plugin
* State is saved to and loaded from IDB by default
* (hopefully universal) support for all processor modules
  supported by IDA itself (including 64bit etc.)
* "plugin" interface - write a plugin for this plugin! ;-)
* IDA disassembly is kept in its original state
* hotkeys "1" and "2" for decrementing and incrementing
  an item's value, respectively (yay, more interactivity).
  this allows you to interactively "browse" the disassembly
  and memory for useful gadgets
* context-sensitive content viewers
  - now used to display data by default
  - visually highlight return instructions

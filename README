Dr.rer.oec.Gadget IDAPython Plugin
==================================

IDAPython plugin for the Interactive Disassembler
which can be used to analyze and create ROP
payload.

what's new:

- fork of Dr.Gadget plugin
- ROP "payload" is saved to/loaded from IDB
- (hopefully universal) support for all processor modules
  supported by IDA itself (including 64bit etc.)
- "plugin" interface - write a plugin for this plugin! ;-)
- IDA disassembly is kept in its original state
- hotkeys "1" and "2" for decrementing and incrementing
  an item's value, respectively (yay, more interactivity)
- context-sensitive content viewer(s), in bunt ;-)

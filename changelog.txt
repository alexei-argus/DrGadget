#   2010/07/31  v0.2   - with kind permission,

#                        script to find opcodes/instructions
#   2010/08/25  v0.3  -  added ARM support
#                        primitive stack/pc tracing for ARM

#                        by Karthik (neox.fx at gmail dot com)
#   2012/09/12 v0.31  -  fixed bug which could prevent files from being loaded (thanks Ivanlef0u)
#                        project is now on github https://github.com/patois/DrGadget.git
#                        Dr. Gadget is now licensed under the Beerware license
#   2013/04/07 v0.4   -  * code modularization
#                        * clean up
#                        * Dr.Gadget can be customized using "plugins" now
#                        * Dr.Gadget aims to be compatible to all the processor modules
#                          that are supported by IDA (including 64bit processor modules)
#                        * added sample plugins
#                        * payload state is saved to idb and restored from it, respectively
#                        
#   2013/06/19 v0.41  -  * some fixes, new disassembly module
#
#   2013/12/18 v0.42  -  * with the introduction of IDA 6.5, there is GetDisasmEx() which allows
#                          code to be disassembled at arbitrary addresses within the IDB. Therefore,
#                          it is no longer required to "destroy" the disassembly by undefining code
#                          using the SDK's MakeUnknown() function, which leaves the original disassembly
#                          intact =)
#                        * This version of Dr.Gadget requires IDA > 6.5.
#
#   2014/07/25 v0.43a -  * changes to disasm module
#                        * made it work "somehow" ;-)
#                        * Decided to release this version as a fork of the "original" Dr.Gadget plugin
#                          under the project name "Dr.rer.oec.Gadget". Most of the new features haven't
#                          (extensively) been tested and/or its implementation been finished.
#                          Although buggy, better release now than never :-P
#                          Please do feel free to fork/modify/do whatever you want and
#                          please use responsibly :-)
